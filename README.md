# Josh's Haskell Learning Log
A log of my experiments to learn Haskell and various related functional programming concepts. 

This is mostly for my own benefit so I can remember what I've done, but maybe someone else will find it helpful.

## Documents
Rough order in which these were written:

* [Monads](monads.md) - following "You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Already Have.)"
* [Maybe](maybe.md) - implementing the Maybe monad
* [Applicative Functors](applicative-functors.md) - following "Applicative programming with effects" McBride and Paterson
